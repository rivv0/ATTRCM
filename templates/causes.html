        <h2>The Role of Transthyretin (TTR)</h2>
        <p>Transthyretin (TTR) is a protein primarily produced by the liver. Its main function is to transport thyroid hormone and vitamin A (retinol) throughout the body. In its normal state, TTR exists as a tetramerâ€”four identical protein subunits bound together.</p>

            <p class="caption">Normal tetrameric structure of transthyretin protein</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Protein Misfolding: The Root Cause</h2>
        <p>ATTR-CM occurs when the TTR protein becomes unstable and dissociates from its tetrameric structure into monomers. These monomers then misfold and aggregate, forming amyloid fibrils that deposit in the heart tissue.</p>
        
        <p>This process leads to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thickening of the heart walls (cardiac hypertrophy)</li>
            <li>Stiffening of the heart muscle (reduced compliance)</li>
            <li>Disruption of electrical conduction</li>
            <li>Impaired cardiac function</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Hereditary ATTR-CM</h2>
        <p>Hereditary ATTR-CM is caused by mutations in the TTR gene, which is located on chromosome 18. Over 120 different mutations have been identified, with varying effects on disease onset, progression, and organ involvement.</p>
        
        <p>Key aspects of hereditary ATTR-CM include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern (only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the disease)</li>
            <li>Variable penetrance (not everyone with the mutation will develop the disease)</li>
            <li>Different mutations are associated with different ethnic groups and geographic regions</li>
            <li>The most common mutation in the United States is V122I, which affects approximately 3-4% of African Americans</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Wild-type ATTR-CM</h2>
        <p>Wild-type ATTR-CM, previously known as senile systemic amyloidosis, is not caused by a genetic mutation. Instead, it is associated with aging and the natural tendency of the TTR protein to become unstable over time.</p>
        
        <p>Characteristics of wild-type ATTR-CM include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Predominantly affects men over the age of 65</li>
            <li>Increasing prevalence with age</li>
            <li>No genetic predisposition</li>
            <li>Often associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, spinal stenosis, and biceps tendon rupture</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
        <p>Several factors may increase the risk of developing ATTR-CM:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> The risk of wild-type ATTR-CM increases significantly after age 65</li>
            <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Wild-type ATTR-CM is more common in men</li>
            <li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Certain mutations are more common in specific ethnic groups</li>
            <li><strong>Family history:</strong> Having a family member with hereditary ATTR-CM increases risk</li>
        </ul>
