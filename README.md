# ATTRCM

What is ATTR-CM?
Amyloid Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a progressive, life-threatening disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils composed of misfolded transthyretin protein in the heart.

ATTR-CM leads to heart failure, arrhythmias, and other cardiac complications. It can be either hereditary (caused by mutations in the TTR gene) or wild-type (associated with aging).

Two Types of ATTR-CM
Hereditary ATTR-CM
Caused by mutations in the TTR gene
Can affect people as early as their 50s
Varies by geographic region and ethnicity
Family history is an important risk factor
Wild-type ATTR-CM
Not caused by genetic mutation
Associated with aging
Typically affects people over 65
More common in men than women
Disease Progression
ATTR-CM is a progressive disease that worsens over time. The buildup of amyloid fibrils in the heart causes the walls to become stiff, making it difficult for the heart to fill with blood and pump efficiently.

As the disease progresses, patients may experience worsening symptoms of heart failure, including:

Increasing fatigue
Shortness of breath
Edema (swelling) in the legs and ankles
Irregular heartbeat
Decreased exercise capacity
Importance of Early Diagnosis
Early diagnosis of ATTR-CM is crucial for several reasons:

It allows for earlier intervention with disease-modifying therapies
It helps prevent irreversible cardiac damage
It improves overall prognosis and quality of life
It enables genetic counseling for family members in hereditary cases
Unfortunately, ATTR-CM is often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to its nonspecific symptoms and the need for specialized testing. Our AI-powered ECG analysis tool aims to improve early detection rates by providing a non-invasive screening method.
